# CBERS on AWS

This repository describes the organization of China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS) data available on AWS and provide additional data and tools for its use.

Information about the CBERS program is available from INPE's site http://www.cbers.inpe.br/ (in Portuguese).

## Accessing CBERS data on AWS

Entry in Open Data on AWS (RODA) is https://registry.opendata.aws/cbers/. Please check this link for updated resources such as project's mailing list, SNS topics, STAC metadata service, etc.

The AWS repository contains the complete archive of CBERS-4 MUX, AWFI, PAN5 and PAN10 scenes.

The images are pulled daily from INPE's catalog at http://www.dgi.inpe.br/catalogo/ and are converted to Cloud Optimized Geotiff format.

The data is organized in two s3 buckets, both located in the us-east-1 region.

### cbers-pds bucket

Scenes are organized using a directory structure based on each sceneâ€™s path, row and acquisition date. For instance, the files for CBERS-4 MUX scene CBERS_4_MUX_20160518_163_128_L4 are available in the following location: ``s3://cbers-pds/CBERS4/MUX/163/128/CBERS_4_MUX_20160518_163_128_L4/``

The naming convention used for the files is ``CBERS\_{N}\_{CAM}\_{YYYYMMDD}\_{PPP}\_{RRR}\_L{L}\_BAND{B}.{tif|xml}``, where:

- ``N ``: mission.
- ``CAM``: camera identification: MUX, AWFI, PAN10M or PAN5M.
- ``YYYYMMDD``: acquisition date.
- ``PPP``: path, see more information on reference grid below.
- ``RRR``: row, see more information on reference grid below.
- ``L``: processing level:
  - 2: system corrected image, expect some translation error.
  - 4: orthorectified with ground control points.
- ``B``: band number
- ``tif|xml``: tif for Geotiff files, xml for metadata files.

cbers-pds is a Requester Pays bucket, which means that you can access it freely within the us-east region, but you will incur charges if you download it from elsewhere.

### cbers-meta-pds bucket

The data is organized using a directory structure identical to the one shown above, the difference is that this bucket stores only quicklooks for each scene. Each directory contains a large and a small quicklook, for instance:

- Large quicklook: ``s3://cbers-meta-pds/CBERS4/MUX/157/133/CBERS_4_MUX_20150607_157_133_L4/CBERS_4_MUX_20150607_157_133.jpg``
- Small quicklook: ``s3://cbers-meta-pds/CBERS4/MUX/157/133/CBERS_4_MUX_20150607_157_133_L4/CBERS_4_MUX_20150607_157_133_small.jpeg``

This bucket also provides manifest files describing all scenes at its root level, in gzipped and plain format:

- MUX camera
  - s3://cbers-meta-pds/MUXscene_list.csv.gz or https://s3.amazonaws.com/cbers-meta-pds/MUXscene_list.csv.gz
  - s3://cbers-meta-pds/MUXscene_list.csv or https://s3.amazonaws.com/cbers-meta-pds/MUXscene_list.csv
- AWFI camera
  - s3://cbers-meta-pds/AWFIscene_list.csv.gz or https://s3.amazonaws.com/cbers-meta-pds/AWFIscene_list.csv.gz
  - s3://cbers-meta-pds/AWFIscene_list.csv or https://s3.amazonaws.com/cbers-meta-pds/AWFIscene_list.csv
- PAN10M camera
  - s3://cbers-meta-pds/PAN10Mscene_list.csv.gz or https://s3.amazonaws.com/cbers-meta-pds/PAN10Mscene_list.csv.gz
  - s3://cbers-meta-pds/PAN10Mscene_list.csv or https://s3.amazonaws.com/cbers-meta-pds/PAN10Mscene_list.csv
- PAN5M camera
  - s3://cbers-meta-pds/PAN5Mscene_list.csv.gz or https://s3.amazonaws.com/cbers-meta-pds/PAN5Mscene_list.csv.gz
  - s3://cbers-meta-pds/PAN5Mscene_list.csv or https://s3.amazonaws.com/cbers-meta-pds/PAN5Mscene_list.csv

The plain csv file does not include a first line with the column ids.

### SNS Topics for available quicklooks

SNS messages are sent to topics when a new quicklook is available in the cbers-pds bucket. The quicklook generation is the last step in the ingestion procedure.

The SNS topics are:

- arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:769537946825:NewCB4MUXQuicklook for MUX quicklooks
- arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:769537946825:NewCB4AWFIQuicklook for AWFI quicklooks
- arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:769537946825:NewCB4PAN10MQuicklook for PAN10M quicklooks
- arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:769537946825:NewCB4PAN5MQuicklook for PAN5M quicklooks

### STAC item topics and catalog

A [STAC](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/) metadata record is generated as soon as a new scene is ingested and its content is published to a SNS topic. Please check the topic ARNs and API endpoints to access the catalog in the [RODA link](https://registry.opendata.aws/cbers/)
